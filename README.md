# BatchExcelConsolidation

This console app will consolidate data from multiple excel files into a single central file.

Debug folder contains demo files. Exe and source files should be in the same directory when ran.

The app performs extraction and insertion of data from multiple excel files into a single consolidated excel file. Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel is used in this scenario and will only work if you're in the Windows environment with the Excel application installed (for the library). A lot of the tags that the app look for is hard coded currently.
